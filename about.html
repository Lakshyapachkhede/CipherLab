        <h3>About CipherLab</h3>

        <p>CipherLab is an educational web application created by <a class="link"
                href="https://lakshyapachkhede.github.io/Lakshyapachkhede/" target="_blank">Lakshya Pachkhede</a> to
            help users learn and experiment with classical encryption techniques. This tool offers a hands-on way to
            explore various historical ciphers, including Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, Playfair Cipher,
            Vigen√®re Cipher, Rail Fence Cipher, and Columnar Cipher.

            The purpose of CipherLab is to provide students, hobbyists, and anyone interested in cryptography with a
            simple and interactive platform to understand how these encryption methods work. By inputting messages,
            selecting algorithms, and providing keys, users can see how ciphers encode and decode text in real time.

            This project is designed purely for educational purposes and encourages curiosity, learning, and
            experimentation in the field of encryption and data security.</p>
